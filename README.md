## What is Language Finder?
Language Finder is a site where users can search the world and see what technologies are being most used around them. They can also submit languages or frameworks they use at their job if they have an account.

## Inspiration For This Project
At a meetup, I saw someone give a short presentation on their project which showed which networking events around you gave out free food. I thought it was an interesting project and a few days later while applying to jobs, a friend and I realized that there wasn't any type of map or site that we knew of which showed which languages or frameworks were being mostly used in our area. I thought back to seeing the "Networking Food Project" at the meetup and I decided to do this personal project.
